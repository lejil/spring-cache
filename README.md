# Spring Boot Caching with Redis
* This project demonstrates how to implement caching in a Spring Boot application using Redis as the caching provider. Redis, an in-memory data store, enhances the performance of applications by reducing database load and speeding up data retrieval through caching. The project showcases a simple and efficient way to cache frequently accessed data and manage cache invalidation.

# Key Features:
* Spring Cache Abstraction: Leverages Spring's caching abstraction for seamless cache management.
* Redis Integration: Uses Redis as a distributed, in-memory cache for high-speed data retrieval.
* Cache Annotations: @Cacheable, @CachePut, and @CacheEvict for declarative caching.
* Custom Cache Configuration: Fine-tuned cache settings including expiration policies and cache sizes.
* Performance Improvement: Demonstrates significant improvement in response times through caching.

# Tech Stack:
* Spring Boot 3.x
* Spring Data Redis
* Redis
* Maven
* Java 17
* This project serves as a foundation for adding robust caching mechanisms to microservices or larger applications, improving performance and scalability.
